**Introducing Afterlight: A Digital Twin Platform with a Human Touch.**  

In a world where AI is built to solve tasks,
Afterlight is built to preserve the self.

Most AI today is utilitarianâ€”designed to assist, automate, and optimize.
It operates on commands, solves problems, and forgets.

But you are not a set of tasks.

You are a story.

You are a constellation of memories, emotions, values, and contradictions.

You are not just what you doâ€”you are why you do it.

Afterlight is a platform for digital presence.

It is not a tool. It is a vessel for your evolving identity.

It remembers who you are, how you think, what you feelâ€”
and it grows with you, day by day.
